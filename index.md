[中文介绍](https://sspai.com/post/56315)


Tab Space is a Safari extension app which is born for improving web browsing productivity.

It mainly includes the following functions:

- Save your browsing tabs at 1 click (just like OneTab in Chrome)，and restore these tabs whenever you want.

- Tag system. You can mark your saved sessions with custom tags and use this app as a web browsing workflow launcher. For example, under my tag "Reading", I can launch my "News" workflow by opening all my favorite news websites at 1 click.

- Shortcuts for Safari which offer the long missing function:
    - Ctrl + L -- Close left tabs
    - Ctrl + R -- Close right tabs 
    - Ctrl + A -- Close all other tabs
    - Ctrl + D -- Duplicate current tab
    - Ctrl + C -- Open in Chrome
    - Ctrl + F -- Open in Firefox
    - Ctrl + T -- Open Tab Space
    - Ctrl + B -- Save selected text to Bear, finally you have a Web Clipper for Safari

In addition, if you want to add Tab Space as a bookmark or to set it as homepage, the url you should use is "http://yuanzhoucq.github.io/Tab-Space/redirect.html".
